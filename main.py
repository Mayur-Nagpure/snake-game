"""
Snake Game - Entry Point
Demonstrates Data Structures and Algorithms using collections.deque

DSA Concepts Demonstrated:
1. Deque: O(1) append/pop operations for snake movement
2. Set operations: O(1) lookup for collision detection optimization
3. Random sampling: Efficient food placement
4. List comprehension: Functional programming for position filtering
5. Event-driven programming: Queue-based event handling
